        The Avengers are Earth's mightiest heroes, a legendary team 
        of superheroes brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D. to face 
        threats too powerful for any one hero to handle. 
        This iconic Marvel ensemble has featured core members like Iron Man,
        Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk, who are often joined by
        a rotating roster of other heroes like Black Widow, Hawkeye, and countless more. 
        From defending New York from alien invasions to battling the cosmic might
        of Thanos, the Avengers stand as a symbol of courage, unity,
        and the power of working together to save the world.

        DC Comics is home to an iconic pantheon of superheroes 
        who are often hailed as modern mythological figures. 
        Unlike the assembled team of the Avengers, many of DC's 
        most famous characters, such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, 
        are timeless icons who operate on a larger-than-life, mythological scale,
        protecting their cities and the world from equally monumental threats.
        Their premier team, the Justice League, brings these legendary individuals
        together to form an unparalleled force for good, representing the very
        pinnacle of heroism and justice in the universe.
