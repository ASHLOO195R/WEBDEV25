                    <strong>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose</strong> (1897): Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian freedom fighter and nationalist leader 
                    who played a crucial role in India’s struggle for independence from British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, he was known for his 
                    fierce patriotism and leadership of the Indian National Army (INA), which sought to overthrow British rule through armed struggle. 
                    Bose’s slogan, “Give me blood, and I will give you freedom,” inspired many Indians to join the fight for independence. 
                    Despite facing opposition from other leaders, his dedication and vision for a free India made him a legendary figure in Indian history.<br>
